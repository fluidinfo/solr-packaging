The packaging workflow has been changed for version 1.4 to make use of GIT,
topgit and debian source version 3.0 quilt. The workflow is described in this
mail:

http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/vcs-pkg-discuss/2009-December/000688.html

Since this is to my knowledge the first package done with this particular
workflow, please consider this packaging a work in progress.

Additional information below:

get-orig-source
===============

The upstream tarball is saved in the GIT repository with pristine-tar. For each
upstream release there are two tarballs saved, one pristine and one stripped
without upstream binaries (.jar, .war), which is used for packaging.

The debian/signatures directory contains the upstream signatures of the
original tarballs. You can check them against the appropriate keyring with:

> pristine-tar checkout solr_1.4.0.orig.tar.gz
> gpg --no-default-keyring --primary-keyring solr-keyring.gpg --import KEYS
> gpgv --keyring solr-keyring.gpg debian/signatures/apache-solr-1.4.0.tgz.asc \
                                  solr_1.4.0.orig.tar.gz

git-buildpackage
================

The branch and tag names conform to gbp defaults. Please look at the gbp
documentation to see how to easily build the package. However you can still
build the package from branch master with dpkg-buildpackage and pristine-tar
checkout.
